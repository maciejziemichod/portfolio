- page with all my projects shown with "Show more" button
- floating things on left and right with socials icons and email, it should disappear when scrolled to contact section
- things connected with favicon, index html comment in head and in folder favicon (manifest, for apple etc)
- button for scrolling all the way up?
- images optimization
- should full list button exist, if so shouldn't it be done in a different way? maybe it should be a button "more info" and it goes to a different page containing more information about me and technologies i've used so far
