## TODOS:

### Important:

- contact me [form](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381150/how-to-send-an-email-from-javascript) OR netflify contact form something OR php api hosted on heroku
- add my photo
- make project mobile friendly and responsive
- page with all my projects shown with "Show more" button
- floating things on left and right with socials icons and email, it should disappear when scrolled to contact section
- images optimization
- should full list button exist, if so shouldn't it be done in a different way? maybe it should be a button "more info" and it goes to a different page containing more information about me and technologies i've used so far
- button for scrolling all the way up on the projects page

### Not important:

- maybe enrich hero section
- custom tooltip
- make every animation done by me transition vue tag
- things connected with favicon, index html comment in head and in folder favicon (manifest, for apple etc)
- custom required message for contact form
- copy to clipboard too fast bug
- router transition effect
